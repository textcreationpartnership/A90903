            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If in the Prophet <hi>Ieremies</hi> time,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.10.</note> the land did mourn becauſe of oathes, why may not ſuch a cauſe produce ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect now alſo?<note place="margin">Hoſea 4.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If in <hi>Hoſea's</hi> time the Lord had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with the inhabitants of the
<pb facs="tcp:115434:3"/>land, becauſe by ſwearing, &amp;c. they brake forth, and blood touched blood: <hi>i.</hi> bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy puniſhments, bloody ſinnes; why may not this heaven-daring ſinne be a ſpeciall promover of the fury of Gods wrath, ſo hotly incenſed againſt this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at this time?</p>
            <p>I know not any one ſinne more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſpread over Court, Citie, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, then this Laws-outfacing Gangren.</p>
            <p>That Gods ſword may bee ſheathed, mans muſt be drawn forth, out of the ſcabbard of ſilence, connivence, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, by correction. It requires the labour of moſt skilfull Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to put to their helping hearts and hands, to the healing of this feſtered wound,<note place="margin">Ezek. 22.30.</note> to make up the hedge, to ſtand in the gap before the Lord, for the Land, (which is as the Buſh in <hi>Moſes</hi> time,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.2.</note> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin, though not conſumed) that hee may not fully deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>Such ſearchers of theſe ſoares have need of Eagles eyes, and Lions hearts, as well as Ladies hands.</p>
            <p>Knotty pieces require the more blowes to break them, foule linnen the more water to cleanſe them, Droſſie
<pb facs="tcp:115434:3"/>ſilver the more refining, and duſty gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the more bruſhing.</p>
            <p>If this Epidemicall ſinne were more frequently, more fervently, preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by Miniſters, I think it would not be ſo freely, ſo fully perſiſted in by men, againſt the Lord.</p>
            <p>The enſuing <hi>Summons for Swearers</hi> will diſcover how this ſinne of ſwearing hath been puniſhed by God, by men, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, heathens.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Errata's</hi> you may meet with in the booke, becauſe while part of it was in the preſſe in the Citie, the Author was in preſſure (and that (almoſt a thing incredible) under the authority of the Parliament) in the countrey, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of malevolent, and malignant adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. The Devill is more delighted with the quenching of the fire of zeale in the hearts of Peachers, then the Pope is pleaſed by the ſprinkling of holy water upon the faces of the people.</p>
            <p>Your inflamed Reſolutions againſt this, and other like ſinnes, this Tract will no whit retard, I hope, but rather ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, enliven, enlarge. Renowned, indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable, reforming, eternizable Senators:
<pb facs="tcp:115434:4"/>conſider God hath done great things by you, for you, that you may doe more for him ſtill.</p>
            <p>You may be bold to truſt God upon triall.</p>
            <p>Theſe are times of warre, and who are to be accounted Souldiers, if you are not? You may bee as confident as the Souldier that <hi>Eràſmus</hi> ſpeakes of, who being told of a numerous Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt, anſwered, <hi>Tanto plus gloriae referemus, quanto ſunt plures quos ſuperabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> The greater the oppoſition, the more illuſtrious the conqueſt ſhall be to you,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7.8.</note> conſidering all Chriſts Souldiers ſhall have a crown, though ſometimes enforced to ſwim to the ſame in ſtreames of blood. In <hi>Exodus</hi> 32. wee read of three ſorts of fire; of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites by ſinne, of God by judgements, of <hi>Moſes</hi> by zeale. The firſt made way for the ſecond, the ſecond for the third.</p>

            <p>He that withſtands a man in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this or any other ſin, though he beares away frowns &amp; heart-burnings for a time, yet when the offending party comes to himſelfe, he recompenſeth his former diſlike, with ſo much the more love, and ſo many the more thanks. The Lord himſelfe will for all eternity ſpeak of ſuch a man, ſuch a Parliament, as ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> This man,<note place="margin">Numb. 25.11.</note> this Parliament that was zealous for my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hath turned away my wrath from the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the people of

By ſo doing your active ſpirits may the rather expect your other workes to bee the more proſperous, your labour bee light, your ſorrowes eaſie, our warres huſhed, our peace permanent, and your own ſalvation certain: which hath been, is, and ſhall be the prayer of</p>

As a groundwork he hath ſet down ſundry diſtinctons of Gods name, and diſcovered above an hundred inventions of taking it in vain. Before he laies his Battery againſt the great ſins of raſh ſwearing, and falſe ſwearing, he judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſetteth down the lawfull and right uſe of ſwearing; and therein anſwereth the Anabaptiſts. Then he diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth wherein this ſin of undue ſwearing lieth, how hainous it is, and how many waies committed; withall, he giveth ſound anſwers to the ſeverall vain Apologies that are made for it, and addeth ſundry motives againſt it; for the better obſerving whereof, he addeth prudent dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: yea, and to ſtrike the greater terrour into mens ſouls againſt this ſin, fearfull judgements of God upon falſe and raſh ſwearers: The like is done about curſing. This treatiſe affords ſuch ſoveraign remedies againſt thoſe Epidemicall maladies, as it is worthy to be publiſhed for <hi>all that ſtand in aw of Gods judgements to read it.</hi> It is a fit Treatiſe to be commended not only to common ſwearers themſelvs, but alſo to others, who may hereby be directed, how to prevent thoſe ſins in ſuch as have not been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed thereunto, and alſo to redreſs them in ſuch as are too much addicted to the ſame.</p>

            <p>I Have ſeen a Tract intituled, <hi>A Summons for Swearers, and a Law for the Lips in reproving them.</hi> I think there is not any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author extant, that contains more plain, pithy, perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diſſwaſives from this ſin of ſwearing, or more variety of examples of Gods judgements upon ſwearers, for ſwearers, curſers; with rules of direction for the reprehenſion of ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for the matter, manner, time; with ſundry arguments to prove the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures againſt all prophane Atheiſticall deniers of the ſame; all eaſie for capacity, and various for delight.</p>
            <p>I wiſh the Book were countenanced by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that every Pariſh, if not Family, might enjoy one to be helpfull to them, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and reformation, neceſſary for theſe times wherein the Land mournes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this of ſwearing, as of any other ſinne. I beleeve the little expence in procuring the Book, would be abundantly recompenced to the ſoules both of theſe ſinners, and to all ſuch whoſe dutie it is to reprove the ſame.</p>

Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome claimes by preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſuch Books as come under the Preſſe to be made publick, ſhould be uſhered with an
<pb facs="tcp:115434:7"/>Epiſtle: which if it want, it calleth into ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, that either the Author hath no friends of worth, or that the worke is not worthy patronage. There are two principall ends <hi>(Right Worſhipfull)</hi> of Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; either that the Patrons ſhould counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the ſubject, or that the ſubject ſhould work upon the Patrons.</p>
            <p>That I may bee aſſured to bee exempted from flattery, I exclude my ſelfe from neither of theſe ends: Seeing ſwearing is a ſinne, whereunto both religious and irreligious are too prone, the one by their common, raſh, and wilfull <hi>ſwearing,</hi> the other by their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, cold, cowardly reproving the ſame: therefore cannot wholly be unfitting you, in which ſide ſoever you are to be ranked. The ſubject being a ſinne ſo univerſally ſpread in Court, Citie, Countrey, it hath need finde ſome that may countenance and patronize it from the biting tongues of thoſe, whoſe wounds it labours to diſcover and cure. I know very few who need not to have the edge of their zeale ſharpened by the whetſtone of Gods holy word, and mens daily remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Miniſters of the Lord. In many things we ſinne all, and in all things ſome: If you be free from this Epidemicall diſeaſe,
<pb facs="tcp:115434:7"/>both in the active and paſsive part, bleſſe God for it, who hath wrought this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cure upon you, ſeeing by nature eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is ſo propine unto it, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned God to bound this precept with ſo ſharp thornes and threats, ſaith <hi>Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Loc.</note> If you are not yet fully free, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor intreats the work may have leave to doe its beſt to make you free. Neither doe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this Tract unto you, onely that you might ſhelter it (being a ſubject of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) from the many ſtormes of malevolent tongues: for I know it is ſit, that whoſoever publiſheth any thing unfit, ſhould beare the whole burthen of his own fault; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ventureth to appeare in print, muſt expect the common lot of all Writers, to bee variouſly cenſured of various diſpoſitions: Some (as <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> burnt the Temple, but kept the Gold) will be content to take the matter, yet blame the Author.</p>
            <p>Others will happily (or rather unhappily) read it, not out of conſcience, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good, but out of curioſity to cenſure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be bad. In all theſe I would never deſire friends to defend, nor feare enemies to deprave me: for what is good will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it ſelfe; and to flatter others (fearing
<pb facs="tcp:115434:8"/>their cenſure for what is bad) were rather impiety towards them, then policie towards my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>To feare any mans cenſure (in ſo cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an age) were imbecillity; and to think ſo to ſpeak or write as to pleaſe all, were to aime at an impoſsibility and either to endevour, were meer folly.</p>
            <p>But your names in a ſelected ſort I make bold to prefix, and that the rather, ſeeing all of you by office and place, I know ſhould be, and moſt of you by affection and practice, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, are profeſſed enemies to this ſoule-killing, heaven-daring, land-loading, peace-diſturbing, and hell-haſtening ſinne.</p>
            <p>If theſe poore and unexpected papers find ſuch kinde and expected entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in your hearts, as the Author oft hath undeſervedly found in many of your houſes, I doubt not but your publicke weekly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in life, will be as powerfull as my pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Sabbath precepts by voyce, to work upon your Servingmen in houſes, your Tenants and many other inferior inhabitants in your Pariſhes, that have neceſſary recourſe unto, and daily dependance on you.</p>
            <p>Touching the Treatiſe it ſelfe, I confeſſe my manner of handling things therein, is
<pb facs="tcp:115434:8"/>like my ſelfe, plain and homely, without any gorgious garment of Rhetoricall Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe I hold it a Maxime (for my ſelfe ever to keep unto) to deſire rather to ſpeak to the edification of the hearers and readers, then for the oſtentation of my ſelfe in ſpeaking or writing: yet I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the matter to be like them from whom I received it, ſound and good, fit to feed all thoſe Chriſtians that deſire rather to have their hungry ſoules fed with the ſincere milk of Gods word, then their itching eares tickled with the enticing ſpeech of mans wiſedome.</p>
            <p>I ſay no more concerning it,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.13.</note> but <hi>Non ſit in vobis nec menſura major, nec menſura minor,</hi> that is, as ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, and as I here apply it, ſubſtract not from this much, little, old, new nothing, what is due unto it; nor aſcribe unto it what it doth not deſerve.</p>
            <p>As God doth, ſo men ſhould eſteeme of the labours of Miniſters, not according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the work, but according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Author.</p>
            <p>Thus fearing to make the windowes or gates too wide, when the houſe and Citie is but little, I commit you heartily to the
<pb facs="tcp:115434:9"/>Lords undeceivable direction, and this Treatiſe humbly to your favourable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, willing application, needfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and doe reſt</p>

            <p>Chriſt divided the Law into two <hi>Tables:</hi> The love of God, and the love of our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Now the foure firſt Commandments contain our dutie to God; the fix laſt, to our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> divides and allots five unto the firſt, and five unto the laſt Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt. Quaeſt.</hi> 71. on <hi>Exod.</hi> ſaith, there be three precepts contained in the firſt table, and ſeaven in the laſt, making the firſt and ſecond commandment but one, and the tenth two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
            <p>But what is his Reaſon?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115434:17"/>A childiſh reaſon, ſaith <hi>Zanchius,</hi> that the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Trinity might hereby be ſpecified.</p>

            <p>This was brought to paſſe by the ſubtilty of the Devill, as the event it ſelfe doth ſufficiently declare; ſeeing by little and little it came to paſſe, that the ſecond Precept was by the Papiſts blotted out; or if added, then either joined with, or hid under the firſt, that it might not appeare that God did abſolutely and of ſet purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Images, but ſuch as whereby God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is repreſented; and to make up the number of ten, they divide the tenth into two precepts, as a man having ſtollen one of ten baggs, divides the ninth into two, that none of the number might be wanting.</p>
            <p>This then you ſee, we rightly are to account the third precept belonging to the firſt table.</p>

            <p>The reaſon of Oathes is grounded upon this point, that foraſmuch as it is preſumed upon by all men, that they doe believe that there is a God, unto whom all ſecrets are open, and of whom faith and truth is well liked: And that on the other ſide he is much offended with lies, and hath ſo great regard of juſtice, that he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict worthy puniſhment on ſuch as forſweare themſelves: It was received by a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and cuſtome of all men, to uſe and take the name of God (the God of all men) for witneſs, when we would have men credit thoſe things which we aſcertaine and confirme by oath to be

               <note place="margin">Hieron. in Matth.</note> a learned Father, held that the liberty of ſwearing by the Name of God, was only granted unto the Jewes, as unto little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, leſt they ſhould ſweare by Devils; even as (ſaith he) God would have ſacrifices offered unto him rather then to Idols, <hi>Homil.</hi> 7. <hi>in Matth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The error of the Anabaptiſts is ſo ſtiffly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, becauſe of the ill underſtanding of the fore-mentioned words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.34. Hereby they would make Chriſt contrary to his Father, as though he had been ſent down upon the earth to abrogate the decree of his Father,<note place="margin">Exo. 22.11</note> ſeeing his Father doth not only permit, but alſo command an Oath.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt affirmes that <hi>He is one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> affirming what he doth; and his <hi>Doctrine not his own:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10.18.30.</note> Now ſhould God diſallow what he once enjoyned, and abrogate what at firſt he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely commanded?</p>
            <p>If we look into the text we ſhall perceive, that the purpoſe of our Saviour was not to reſtrain
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115434:27"/>oathes, but only to purge the Law from the falſe Gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſees; not wholly condemning oathes, but ſuch only as tranſgreſſe the rules of the Law.</p>
            <p>It appears that the people then only feared and ſhunned Perjuries, when as the Law did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhibit perjuries, but all idle, vain and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous oathes. For Chriſt, the beſt expoſitor of the Law, informed and admoniſhed them, that not forſwearing, but alſo vain ſwearing was a ſin, and a breach of the Law. Vain ſwearing, I ſay: For other Oathes by the Law commanded, or commended, he leaves untouched, as ſafe and free.</p>
            <p>Whereas they (the Anabaptiſts) dwell ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removeably upon the word, <hi>Non omnino, not at all,</hi> we muſt know, that it is not to be reſtrained unto the word <hi>Swearing,</hi> but to the ſubjected formes of ſwearing <hi>by heaven, earth, &amp;c.</hi> For that was the error of the Jewes, that they thought when they ſware by heaven, earth, or ſuch like oathes, they took not Gods name in vain, nor tranſgreſſed this third Precept, if they named not <hi>God</hi> in their oathes. Therefore our Saviour took away all colour of excuſe or objection; ſeeing when they ſware either by heaven, or earth, the light, Baptiſme [never naming the name of <hi>God</hi>] they notwithſtanding did indirectly take Gods name in vain, ſeeing all theſe benefits are pledges of his liberality, and on every of them his name remains engraven.</p>

               <hi>Not at all</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aug.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note>) not becauſe to ſweare is a ſin, but becauſe to forſweare is a great ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115434:28"/>Chriſts meaning then is, <hi>Sweare not at all,</hi> that is, not at all by any creature, upon what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoever; or not at all by God himſelfe falſly or unadviſedly, neither diſorderly for affection, nor childiſhly for imitation, nor deſperately for cuſtome, nor cunningly for deceit; Oher oathes which fail not in the conditions required in <hi>Jer.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>How doe the Nations praiſe the Lord?

            <p>By the fore mentioned place of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. it is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115434:28"/>cleare, that an oath is not evill; for as he that doth begin ſtrifes among other, or hinder their atonement, is reputed anoyſome enemy, a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.9.</note> a child of the Devill, and therefore cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: ſo that muſt needs be a commodious matter, whereby contentions are ſuppreſſed, truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, and peace eſtabliſhed.</p>

            <p>The Romans had an uſe that he that would ſweare by <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſhould go forth of the doores
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115434:30"/>and be well adviſed, and take ſome pauſe before he ſwear: For they held that <hi>Hercules</hi> did ſwear but once in all his life, and that was to the ſon of King <hi>Augeas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This deliberation in their Idolatrous oaths, ſhould admoniſh Chriſtians to be well adviſed in ſwearing by the Name of God.</p>
            <p>An oath was brought in among men for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and at firſt to be laid on men as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when one could not be believed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his bare word; yet now it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſo much for it ſelf, as for the evills that do enſue thereby.</p>
            <p>And ſo little ſhall ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning the truth and uſe of the firſt <hi>Doctrine:</hi> Rightly to ſweare, is to ſanctifie Gods name, and ſhall by him certainly be rewarded; gathered out of the affirmative part of this third Precept.</p>

            <p>Now before it comes by God to be puniſhed, it comes among men to be queſtioned, what is ſinfull ſwearing, and what is not.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, no time ſeems exempt from this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous ſin.</p>
            <p>Are men merry? Oathes flie out as the muſick of their mirth. Are they earneſt in gaming, or in bargaining? Oathes are the period, if not the preface to their ſpeeches, and theſealers to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bargain; ſeeking to gain the world, and to loſe their ſouls. Are they purpoſed to perpetrate any wickedneſſe? They confirm their purpoſe with bloody oathes, as if God were a ſurety for their ſin.</p>
            <p>As by much labour the hand is hardened, that it hath no ſenſe of labour: ſo much ſwearing cauſeth ſuch a brawny skin of ſenſeleſneſſe to over-ſpread the memory, heart and conſcience of the ſwearer, that he ſwears oft-times at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares; and having ſworn, hath no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his oath, much leſſe repentance for his ſinne.</p>
            <p>Fourthly as there is univerſality, ſo alſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of new faſhioned oathes.</p>
            <p>As men take pride in ſtrange kinds of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, ſo alſo of new faſhioned oathes. As ſome
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115434:33"/>try their wits in the invention of new-fangled attires; ſo many limbs of Satan deviſe unheard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of oathes, that by this varietie they may take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ſaciety of ſwearing, &amp; keep themſelves unglutted w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the common uſe of the ſame <hi>oaths:</hi> Sometime ſwearing, and that commonly <hi>by</hi> the dreadfull name of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, <hi>by his life, ſoule, body, heart, wounds, blood:</hi> Sometime <hi>by the Lord Jeſus, by Chriſt, heaven, aire, Sun, light, Maſſe, Rood, our Lady, Saint Mary, Saint Anne:</hi> Sometime <hi>by my ſoule, this ſilver, croſſe of the coin, by theſe ten bloody bones, hand, bread, drinke, faith, troth:</hi> Sometime mincing their oathes, at if God could not eſpy them, when as men may; as, <hi>by Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Maskins, s'lid, burlady, s'foot, by my fay, by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Tan, yea Mary, by yea and by nay:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Perkins.</note> A volume will ſcarce contain the multitude of their oathes, and therfore the Lord hath in ſtore for them a whole volume of his plagues,<note place="margin">Zach. 5.2.</note> the vials whereof being poured downe upon them, in the end they ſhall be inforced to confeſſe,<note place="margin">Pſa. 56.11.</note> 
               <hi>Doubtleſſe there is a God that judgeth the earth.</hi> Swearing is now in the eare, which before was in the blade: the regions being now white, and this ſin grown to be ripe and yellow, what remaineth, but that we look for the Angel of the Lord ſhortly to thruſt in his ſickle?</p>
            <p>Miniſters they may take up the complaint of children in the market-place, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.32. <hi>We have piped unto you, and yee have not daunced; wee have mourned unto you, &amp; ye have not wept:</hi> the joyful promiſes have beene propoſed, whereby you might be allured; the dolefull threatnings have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115434:34"/>been delivered, whereby you might be deterred from this ſin, and yet all in vain.</p>
            <p>And what then? Is the whole body of this Land full of ſores and corruptions, and ſhall we ceaſe to uſe more and ſharper corraſives to cure? Do men lie, continue and delight in ſleeping in this ſin, and ſhall not wee ſound out the trumpet of Gods threatnings the more loudly? ſhall we with the falſe Prophets, ſpeak pleaſing things, ſowing pillows under mens arm-holes, ſaying, Swearing is no ſin; or but a ſmall one? no ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for this is neither good for us, nor for them; not for us, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul, There is a woe to us, if we preach not the Goſpel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.16</note> 1 Cor. 6.16. not for them, ſaith the Lord, their hurt is not cured by ſweet words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.14. when the Prophets ſhall cry <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 6.14.</note> and there ſhall be <hi>no peace</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>The calmeſt ſunſhine doth leſs purifie the aire then the terribleſt thunder and lightening: the pleaſanteſt potion doth ſeldom purge ſo kindly, as the bitterſt pill: ſo words that to the ear are the ſweeteſt, are not alwayes to the heart the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt. Therefore every one of us that are Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions of ſouls, have need to cut and launce this feſtred ſore of ſwearing: though patients are impatient, and ſmart at the quick; and wee our ſelves indure with <hi>Moſes</hi> murmuring, with <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſmiting, with <hi>Jeremy</hi> impriſoning, with <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> beheading, even for the ſtriking at the root of this ſin, of many other moſt haynous, of all other moſt common, as a general Leproſie, over-ſpreading the whole body of this Nation from the Cedar to the Shrub, from the higheſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115434:34"/>to the loweſt, from the richeſt to the pooreſt, from the mightieſt to the meaneſt.</p>
            <p>If the Cards run againſt them, they will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, their tongues ſhall run as faſt againſt God: if they are croſt in drinking of healths, in dice, in hawking, in hunting, or any other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are deareſt to them, they will curſe God in his honour, which is deareſt to him. What mind can but grieve to conceive it? What heart but bleed to think upon it? What eye but weep to ſee it? What eare but tingle to heare it?</p>
            <p>But let them continue to ſet their tongues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heaven, heaven will ſend down thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts againſt them; if they often daſh againſt Chriſt, and will take no warning, at length Chriſt will fall upon them,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.44</note> and grind them to powder.</p>
            <p>If they eſcape the hands of men, the Lord ſurely <hi>will not hold them guiltleſſe that take his Name in vain.</hi> And,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> 
               <hi>it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the lawes of men have but meanly provided againſt this tranſgreſſion, and doe ſlowly puniſh it, men being ſcarce ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended when Gods name is abuſed, as when their own credit is queſtioned; Yet when the <hi>Lion hath roared, who will not feare?

            <p>Swearing either by the body of God, which tempts to blaſphemy; or by the wounds of Chriſt, to irreverence; are mortall ſins, though it be true which is ſworn.</p>
            <p>We are commanded not only not to take up Gods name falſly, but not vainly, idlely, when the matter is not worth proving by oath. And he

               <hi>as by the name of God, or by the blood or wounds of Christ, I ſweare but little oathes; by this light, by this bread, by mackins, by my troth, our Lady, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>He that uſeth to pilſer ſmall things,<note place="margin">2.</note> by Gods judgement will be brought to ſteale greater things: ſo he that accuſtometh to utter ſmall, will by Gods juſt judgment, be brought to broach great, horrid, helliſh oathes, that juſtly may cauſe the break-neck of his ſoule.</p>

            <p>When evil things, ſaith he, began to increaſe in the world, when there was a confuſion in every place, when all faith was loſt, &amp; unfaithfulneſs reigned, then began the Infidels (ſeeing one would not truſt or beleeve another) in matters of controverſie to call upon their Gods for witneſſes, proteſting they ſpake the truth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they called their Gods to witneſſe in the matter (whom to name they thought it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but in grave and weighty matters) and by this means obtained they faith one of another.</p>
            <p>Now for a ſmuch as God had ſelected the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites from the Gentiles, to be his peculiar people, and would by no means that in any point they ſhould follow the wickedneſſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, he gave a commandement unto them, that in all matters of controverſie, and in ſuch affairs as ſhould make for his glory, they ſhould not call any of thoſe falſe gods whom the Ethnicks worſhipped, unto witneſſe, as to ſweare by their names: But to call him to witneſſe, and to ſweare by his name, and ſo every one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve another for the reverence and honour that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115434:41"/>they owe to his moſt great, fearfull, holy, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, glorious name.</p>

            <p>It was accounted and puniſhed as ſacriledge for any man to anoint himſelfe with the holy oyle appointed for the Tabernacle: And can they hope to eſcape ſcot-free that ſacrilegiouſly meddle with the ſacred name of God?</p>
            <p>The Jewes had the name of God in ſuch reverence,<note place="margin">Willet <hi>on Exod.</hi> Buxtorf. Heb. Lex. verb.

            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:115434:43"/>Yea, among them the name of God was ſo reverenced, that being written in plates, it was lawfull for none to carry it but the high Prieſt: But now as a thing moſt common,<note place="margin">Chryſeſt.</note> wee every where carry about the name of God.</p>
            <p>It was an uſe among the heathen to keep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſuch names as they would have in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. There was a hidden and ſecret name of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is not now known, which they ſay by the decree of the gods is kept ſecret, and one <hi>Marenus Soracius</hi> for naming the ſame but once, was adjudged to death.</p>
            <p>The name <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> which the Gentiles held to be the firſt God, was not uttered; they thought when he was named, the earth would tremble.

            </p>
            <p>Thus the name of the true God among the Jewes, the names of falſe Gods among the Gentiles, were highly reverenced: And if the Gentiles were thus curious in not profaning the names of their Idols, it teacheth that it is a ſhame among Chriſtians irreverently to name and ſweare by the name of the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus</hi> was in ſuch reſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Egyptians, that in reverence of him it was not lawfull to pronounce his name common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or raſhly.</p>

            <p>Now if the names of ſinfull men have been had in ſuch reſpect and reverence, what reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may we think due to the name of God, which is, as one ſaith, a name to bee feared for power, admired for wiſedome, praiſed for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: For this is a great God, and therefore to be feared; a wiſe God, and therefore wonderfull; a good God, and therefore praiſe-worthy.</p>

            <p>It's to be feared that a common ſwearer is a lyer; hee that feareth not the one, feareth not the other; hee that will diſhonour God, will deceive his neighbour; hee that will make no conſcience of the firſt, will make no conſcience of the ſecond Tatble.<note place="margin">Mot. <hi>12.</hi>

            <p>It is an argument of want of faith,<note place="margin">Mot. <hi>15.</hi>

            <p>It overthroweth our affiance in him as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, whom we daily deſpite, as though he were our enemy. How can we with aſſurance hold up our heads at the Tribunall of Chriſt, when our conſcience ſhall tell us, we ſeldome remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him but to blaſpheme him, and have more often named him in our oaths then in our prayers?</p>
            <p>If you do believe in God, why do you ſo diſhonour the glory of his name? If you do not believe in God why would you have mee to believe in you, when you ſweare by that God in whom your ſelf do not believe?</p>

            <p>Many are of opinion, (which judge without diſcretion) that it is evill to doe any thing for feare of puniſhment, but all for love; and if we abſtain from any evill for feare, wee are in a wrong courſe; But we ſee here in this Text, and in <hi>lam.</hi> 5.12. the Lord is content to uſe this as a reaſon good and ſtrong, and will be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to us, if we feare to ſweare becauſe of his wrath and our condemnation.

            <p>Love of obedience indeed doth allure the beſt, but feare of puniſhment doth compell the moſt.</p>
            <p>We know that fire will burn, and becauſe we know it, by no meanes almoſt can bee brought to put our finger in the fire; and doubtleſſe, if we were perſwaded that finne would burn as a fire, we would not ſo eaſily act it with our hands, utter it with our tongues, or hatch it in our hearts.</p>
            <p>The diſcourſe between <hi>Eſops</hi> Fox and Goat will informe us, that it is eaſie to fall into ſinne, but hard to come out; The Fox perſwaded and prevailed with the Goat to goe down with him into a pit to drink; having done, the Fox by the help and height of the Goats back, got out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: The Goat requiring help to come up, the Fox replied, If thou hadſt as much wit in thy head, as thou haſt haire on thy beard, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt have looked not onely how to goe in, but alſo before-hand how to come out.</p>

            <p>Although he ſeem to live, yet is he dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, having received his deadly wound as ſoon as he hath uttered a ſinfull oath.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115434:51"/>So likewiſe the Sweaeer, the oath is no ſooner gone out of his mouth, but he is come to the place of judgement, hee is condemned ſtraight-wayes unto eternall condemnation, wearing the halter ready to be hanged.</p>
            <p>Though he be freed from Gods plagues, as the thiefe is till he comes to the gallows, yet he may be as ſure to endure them, as if already they were inflicted. And the longer their puniſhment is deferred, the ſorer will it be when they come to be judged.</p>
            <p>Swearers think, ſeeing they take no notice of God, that God will take no notice of them. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that every idle word they ſhall ſpeake,</hi>

            <p>Swearing hath been puniſhed by men; by God. By men, heathen and Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>It was puniſhed of the Romans with throwing down from the rock <hi>Tarpeius:</hi> Therefore when they did ſweare, they held a ſtone in their hand and proteſted; If I lie or ſwear ought but truth, caſt me downe from the hill violently, as I fling this ſtone from me.</p>
            <p>Of he Egyptians with loſs of head, of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians with loſs of ears, of the Scythians with loſs of goods, of the Turks with no admiſſion of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour with forfeiture of money, of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour with putting to death, of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of France with ſearing the lips, of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt King of England, with a payment to the poore for every oath vainly uttered, who cauſed within his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace a Duke to pay 40. ſhillings, a Lord 20. ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, a Knight or Gentleman ten ſhillings, a yeoman three ſhillings foure pence, a Page or Servant to be ſcourged. A good Law to baniſh oathes out of a Land, Court, Citie, Countrey, leſt oathes baniſh men out of all.</p>

               <hi>Joſephus</hi> counſelleth, that the Blaſphemer ſhould be ſtoned, and then hanged up one whole day, afterwards being taken down he ſhould be throwne into a pit, without any ſolemne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.</p>

            <p>Thus by men hath ſwearing been puniſhed, ſo alſo by God hath it been puniſhed. And this our little Iſland hath not been barren of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in this kind.</p>

               <hi>Perkins</hi> in the government of the tongue tels of a ſerving-man in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> who for every trifle had an uſe to ſweare no leſs oath, then <hi>Gods precious blood;</hi> He would not be warned by his friends to leave it; at laſt he was viſited with grievous ſickneſs, in the time whereof he would not be perſwaded to repent thereof, but hearing the Bell to toll, he did very hardly, in the anguiſh of death,<note place="margin">

            <p>Thus you have heard how ſwearing hath been puniſhed here in this life, and it ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed alſo in the life to come. There is no middle between theſe two extremes; they that will not amend their ſwearing by perſwaſion, God will end it and them by deſtruction: their judgement was here threatened in thunder and lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will be inflicted there with fire and brimſtone.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory relates concerning <hi>Michael</hi> a Jewiſh Rabbin, who brake his neck as he was ſwearing and blaſpheming the name of Jeſus. Three ſouldiers paſſing through a wood in the Countrey of <hi>Samartia;</hi> there aroſe a tempeſt of thunder and lightning, which, though commonly it maketh the greateſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115434:57"/>Atheiſt to tremble, yet one of them to ſhew his contempt of God and his judgements, burſt forth into blaſphemie and deſpightings of God: But the Lord ſoon tamed his unruly and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tongue; for he cauſed the wind to blow up by the root a huge tree that fell upon him and cruſhed him to pieces, the other eſcaping to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie unto the world of his deſtruction.</p>
            <p>At a Village called <hi>Benavides</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> two young men being together in a field, there ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly aroſe a terrible rempeſt, and withall ſo violent a whirle-wind, that it amazed thoſe that beheld it; The two young men ſeeing the fury thereof coming amain towards them, to avoid the danger, ran as faſt away as poſſibly they might, but make what haſt they could, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke them; who fearing leſt the ſame ſhould ſwing them up into the aire, fell flat down on the earth, where the whirle-wind whisking round about them a pretty while, and then paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forth, the one of them aroſe ſo altered and changed, and in ſuch an agony, that he was ſcarce able to ſtand on his feet; the other liyng ſtill, and not ſtirring, ſome others afar off that ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an hedge, went to ſee how hee did, and found him to be ſtark dead; for all his bones were ſo cruſhed, that the pipes and joints of his armes and legs were as eaſie to be turned the one way as the other, as though his body had been made of Moſs: and beſides, (which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be noted) his tongue was pulled out by the roots, which could not by any means be found, though they ſought for it diligently;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115434:57"/>and this was the miſerable end of this wretched man, who was noted to be a great outragious ſwearer and blaſphemer of Gods moſt holy Name: The Lord choſe him out, ſaith the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Anthonio de Torquemeda,</hi> to make him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the world, of his juſtice againſt Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>I my ſelfe knew two moſt notorious Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers (whoſe names I conceale in reverence to the living) that brake their necks as the common fame filled all mens eares; the one from a paire of ſtaires, the other from off his horſe: Their lives were ſinfull, their deaths fearfull, and their now preſent eſtate, as onely known unto God, I leave as doubtfull.</p>
            <p>The author of the <hi>Arraignment of an unruly Tongue,</hi> relates of a ſwearing Courtier at <hi>Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> who in the midſt of his blaſphemous oaths was taken up, and carried away by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip Stubs</hi> tells us of one whom he knew for a dozen (for that is his own word) or ſixteen years together, whoſe uſuall and common oath was to ſweare <hi>by Gods Armes;</hi> In the end his arm being hurt by a knife, could never be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by any meanes, but ſtill wrankled and feſtred from day to day, and at laſt ſo rotted, that it fell away peece-meale, and he himſelfe through an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and pain thereof died. As he offended by ſwearing by Gods arms, ſo the Lord plagued him in his arm alſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>German</hi> hiſtories tell us, that at <hi>Tabinga,</hi> a deſperate boy deviſed new oathes as were not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115434:58"/>common in uſe; but the Lord ſent a Canker, or ſome worſe diſeaſe, that ate out his tongue, even the very inſtrument wherewith hee blaſphemed God.</p>
            <p>Thinkeſt thou, as Chriſt ſpake concerning thoſe <hi>Galileans</hi> and <hi>Silonions</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 13.) that theſe puniſhed were greater ſwearers then thou thy ſelfe? I tell thee nay, &amp;c. If thou marcheſt with them in their ſinnes, how canſt thou but ſmart in their puniſhments? Happy art thou if their falls cauſe thee by repentance to riſe from this ſin of ſwearing.</p>
            <p>The laſt, though not the leaſt means to be uſed againſt ſwearing, for the prevention and expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame, is, Miniſters to uſe the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and Magiſtrates the temporall ſword for the ſtriking at the root of this ſinne, ſo common, ſo hurtfull.</p>

            <p>And when I have run through theſe particular paſſages, you may expect a period to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſwearing, and reproving the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The matter what: We muſt reprove and puniſh this ſin of ſwearing,<note place="margin">1 The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what.</note> if ever we expect the ſuppreſſion thereof.</p>
            <p>Reprove and puniſh, for I joyn them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe reproofe is a verball puniſhment, and puniſhment a reall reproof: herein follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the method of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> that judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, who on <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.5. confounds reproof and correction together.</p>
            <p>And to ſome it appertains to reprove only according to their conſcience and calling, and to others both to reprove and puniſh: ſuch are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in reſpect of ſubjects, Maſters in reſpect of ſervants, Tutors in reſpect of ſcholars, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in reſpect of children, and houſholders in reſpect of their families.</p>
            <p>For every King or mighty Monarch, is but <hi>Magnus Paterfamilias,</hi> a great houſholder, and every houſholder is <hi>parvus Rex,</hi> a little King in

            <p>Some ſharp courſe, I ſay, ſome having power and authority to deale herein more ſharply then others, that ſo privat men privatly in their owne families, may in time effect that which by a more publick law and ſharp puniſhment were to be wiſhed to be enacted for the whole land.</p>
            <p>Till ſome ſuch ſharp courſe and generall law by ſome godly <hi>Phineas</hi> be procured, let us in our ſeverall callings goe ſo farre as Gods word doth enjoyn, and mans law permit for the ſuppreſſing this ſinne, which being ſo directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly practiſed againſt God himſelfe, cannot bee too much preached againſt by his miniſters.</p>
            <p>For if you ſay to me, Why doe you harp ſo long upon this ſtring?</p>
            <p>I ſay to you, Why do you continue ſo long in this ſinne? Your practice, your practice, which hath been evill, hath occaſioned my preaching, which then hath been good, if by this great pains and long labour, you are at length brought to the ſight of the greatneſſe of this your ſinne, and the ſeverity of Gods judgements againſt the ſame, that ſo you may endeavour to perform for the good of others alſo, which I endevour
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115434:65"/>now to perſwade you unto; namely, to reprove and puniſh ſwearers.</p>
            <p>Reprove, I ſay, and puniſh; for I told you ere-while, that in this diſcourſe I confound both together, and you in the application may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take them aſunder.</p>
            <p>You who are Maſters, Parents, Governours, whoſe calling is to puniſh, when I name reprove underſtand you puniſh: And you whoſe calling is to reprove onely, when I name puniſh, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you reprove; that ſo my ſpeech may not be miſapplied that is rightly intended, but that the fiſh of your ſoules may be caught by one of thoſe baits, you performing one of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; reproving, or puniſhing ſwearers.</p>
            <p>And ſo relying upon Gods good bleſſing for ſucceſſe, I lanch into the deep, intreating you to ſuffer this net of Gods word, not to ſwim in the ſhallowneſſe of your eares alone, but alſo to ſink into the depth of your hearts, that ſo at length you may have true cauſe to ſay and ſing with <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, O God I thanke thee, this day is ſalvation come into my houſe.</hi> I that before blaſphemed thy name by my vain, raſh, helliſh oathes, now am perſwaded, reſolved, to endevour to ſanctifie thy name by reproving, puniſhing others that do blaſpheme the ſame, that ſo hereby my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to others may be manifeſted their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to themſelves aſſured, the former negligence of either by the future diligence of both requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and countervalued.</p>
            <p>And ſo from the wide gates, I make haſte into the little Citie, for feare you ſhould imagine my

            <p>That this duty of reproving and puniſhing ſwearers, is to be performed, is proved by the Prophet, the only meanes to divert Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from a land, is to hinder ſinne, that men <hi>break not forth by ſwearing, lying, whoring, ſtealing, &amp;c.</hi> For theſe ſins breaking forth, Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments break in.</p>

            <p>Therefore there muſt be no ſilence, but ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, contending.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould we refuſe the combat, and doubt of the victory? Swearers have the world on their ſide, we have the word; They cuſtome, we conſcience; They men, we God; They dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we light; They error, we truth, which is ſtrongeſt of all. Through Gods mercie, and the might of Chriſt, we ſhall be more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours.</p>
            <p>But if wee refuſe to ſtrive for the Lord of Hoſts, then hath he a <hi>controverſie,</hi> and will ſtrive againſt us. <hi>Therefore ſhalt thou fall in the day, and the Prophet alſo ſhall fall in the night,</hi> both the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and the ſufferer; <hi>ſcil.</hi> the non-reprover of him.</p>
            <p>And will the Lord ſtrive, plead,<note place="margin">Iob. 12. 1 Sam. 15.22. Levit. 26.24. Pſal. 18.26.</note> and have a controverſie with us?

            <p>We are they that live in the laſt and worſt dayes, wherein it ſeemes to be a leſſer offence to ſweare ordinarily, raſhly, falſly, then to reprove men for their ſo ſwearing.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that our Saviour teacheth us to pray, is, that <hi>Gods name may be hallowed;</hi> and ſhall it be our laſt care, or rather no care at all, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch as doe diſhonour the ſame?</p>

            <p>Sinne is ſinne whereſoever it is; the bodies of great and rich men ſhall become the like preyes to wormes and rottenneſſe; and their ſouls ſhall undergoe like ſtrict examination, as the bodies and ſoules of the meaneſt perſons: When this great game at Cheſſe is here ended, they muſt with others be laid up together in the common bagge of nature, and then there ſhall be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene their duſt, and that of the poore begger. They all proceed from the ſame lamp, and they all without envying either the other, ſhall be content to lodge in the ſame Inne.</p>
            <p>Great men may need admonition, and why ſhould not they have it, if they need it? For elſe were they more miſerable then common men;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115434:68"/>and <hi>Solomons woe</hi> were eſpecially upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when they <hi>fall,</hi> there is <hi>none to help them up</hi> again, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p>It being granted that they may fall, and that falling they are to be raiſed by reprehenſion and admonition, if they are ſo faſt rocked aſleep, that a ſoft ſpeech of admonition will not, they are then to be rouſed by the thundring trumpet of louder reprehenſion.</p>
            <p>The matter of admonition it is to be fitted to the fault, but the manner is to be framed to the beſt advantage of prevailing, with a regard to the dignitie of his perſon, and the remainder of his vertues.</p>
            <p>Let it appeare that, that which ſpeaks is love, and that for which it ſpeaks, ſalvation. And how can any heart ſhut it ſelf againſt love, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it ſalvation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miror, ſi aliqu is rectorum poteſt ſalvari,</hi> It is a wonder if any great man be ſaved (ſaith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>) alledged by Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> before King <hi>Edward:</hi> The reaſon is ready, becauſe there are ſo few to tell and admoniſh them of their faults, the greatneſſe of the one much daunteth the goodneſſe and courage of the other, that it dares not ſo freely and fully reprove their ſaults.</p>
            <p>If Swearers be ſo great that Miniſters dare not reprove, or that the Magiſtrates will not lay hold on them; or ſo cunningly mince their oaths, that the Law cannot reach them; yet then, and there will Gods Law begin, when and where mans law doth leave and end: where Miniſters and others dare not ſpeak vocally, there God
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115434:69"/>dares and will ſpeak really. Though they dazle the eye, ſtop and ſeal the lips, and manicle the hands of men, yet of God they cannot; and the leſſe they feele at the hands of men, the heavier ſhall they feel the hand of God, either in their eſtates, or in their bodies, or in their ſouls, or in their poſterities, or in all.</p>
            <p>Though before men they refuſe to come to ſhame, by ſubmitting themſelves to reproofe, yet God will not forget them, but bring them to it, either in this life to their converſion, or in the world to come to their full and finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David, Hezekiah, Jehoſophat, Peter,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; therefore great men, if ſinners, if ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, may, muſt be reproved; yea be they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe good and wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.9. Rich garments require bruſhing, fine linnen waſhing, pleaſant gardens watring.</p>
            <p>All men will grant that a child or ſervant ought willingly to be reprehended of a father or maſter, but few will in practice grant that a father or maſter ſhould liſten to the reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſonne or ſervant: <hi>Job</hi> therefore may bee a good preſident to all ſuch, either maſters or fathers: He durſt not <hi>open his mouth,</hi> as himſelfe witneſſeth of himſelfe, to contemne the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſervant, or maid,</hi> when they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him; becauſe in a dutie of pietie, we muſt looke to them, not as ſervants, but as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, not to the <hi>ſpeakers</hi> ſo much, who in reſpect of calling may be our inferiours, as to the things ſpoken in the ordinance of God, unto whom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115434:69"/>man is an inferiour, and with whom there is no reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>As great and good men, ſo kindred and friends as well as ſtrangers and foes, muſt be reproved, if by their ſwearing they preſume to take Gods Name in vaine.</p>
            <p>Many offend againſt this rule, who will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rebuke this or any other ſinne, untill God revenge it from heaven. But ſuch are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly friends, becauſe whereas they might by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition in time prevent the judgement of God upon them (whom they in ſhew, and not in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in tongue, and not in truth love moſt dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) they doe not admoniſh them. But what ſin, whether ſwearing or the like, they doe miſlike in ſtrangers, or neighbours, the ſame ſin they doe allow and not miſlike by reproving, when it comes to kindred, wife, children, parents, as though the diverſitie of ſubjects could make that to be ſinne in ſome, which is not ſinne in other ſome. But to end this point, let not the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering beames of any outward reſpect either of great men or kindred, ſo dazle or blind our eyes, as that we ſhall not eſpie ſin in either to reprove it.

            <p>Why ſhould there not be as well a libertie, as a neceſſitie of reproving?</p>
            <p>Yet there is a wiſdome as well as a libertie, and it were to be wiſhed that they that have this wiſdome, would alſo make uſe of this libertie, and if take the libertie, then to take this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with it. The wiſe manner of reproving, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes makes the reproofe it ſelfe effectuall.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Greeneham,</hi> whoſe body quietly endured much launcing at the hand of the temporall Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, and therein manifeſted himſelfe a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of patience, and who himſelfe in the curing of the wounds of mens ſouls was an expert Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, gives this Advice: <hi>Pag.</hi> 101. <hi>As it falls out</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in ſoares, ſo it commeth to paſſe in ſinnes;</hi> We cannot away to have our wounds oft launced and grated on the quicke, but to be fed with healing ſalves, bathed in the mercies of God, and plaiſtered over with ſweet promiſes rather then ripped up to the bottome; whereas it is far ſafer before incarnative and healing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, to uſe corraſive and mundifying waters, without which, though ſome ſoares may ſeeme to cloſe and skin apace, yet they prove worſe, being rotten ſtill at the coare, and having above a thin skin, and beneath nothing but dead fleſh.</p>
            <p>It is more ſound Chirurgery (ſaith he) to prick and pierce the Conſcience with the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iron of the Law, and to cleanſe the wounds of our ſoules by the ſharpe threatnings thereof,

            <p>Yet (with ſubmiſſion to the judgement of the learned) in this particular of reproving Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are ſo hardned and wilfull in this feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinne, I account it better to deale with them mildly at the firſt in reproving them, till wee finde ſome ſhew of contrition, and afterwards endeavour by ſharpe threats to humble them, to worke a through reformation in them. For ſo in another place of his Workes, (to wit, <hi>Pag.</hi> 631.) I finde the ſame Author adviſing thus; In admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition (whether of Swearers, or any other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) wee muſt uſe diſcretion and degrees; as good Phyſitians, wee muſt not at the firſt urge the moſt forcible medicines, but uſe them in their degree and place, when and where more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable meanes prevaile not: not applying too ſtrong purgations at the firſt with <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> leſt our impatient patients be notable to beare them; eſpecially ſeeing man by nature is unwilling to receive any reprehenſion, notwithſtanding it be gentle: When a ſpot is ſhewed to be in our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee are ready to take up mire, and to caſt it on his coate that poynted at our ſpot; or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat in our face by a glaſſe, wee are ready to break the glaſſe that firſt ſhewed us our blemiſh.</p>
            <p>Thoſe admonitions are moſt commendable and effectuall, which ayme at the good of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and not thoſe which fit moſt with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Reprover.</p>

            <p>And in his 28. <hi>Page,</hi> wee muſt rather winne men with a loving admonition, then goare them with a ſharpe reprehenſion: Conſidering (ſaith he) how you muſt put on you the perſon of the offender, that as you ſpare not his ſin, becauſe of the zeale of Gods glory, ſo you preſſe it not too far, becauſe of compaſſion to a brother.</p>

            <p>Wee muſt not give over, notwithſtanding the little ſeeming ſucceſſe of this dutie; perhaps wee ſinned in the manner of reproving for want of wiſdome, or wee would too much have gloried in our ſelves if wee had done good, or wee did convince Judgement generally, and not apply things to their circumſtances particularly, or we did all without love, or without prayer, and ſo
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115434:79"/>though we plant and ſow, God denieth the firſt and the latter rain to bleſſe our labours: or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are to be comforted and encouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hope of God in time to come.</p>
            <p>For experience proveth that ſome at the firſt, receiving of an admonition moſt hardly, have afterwards much profited by it: And others receiving an admonition very gently, have loſt the fruits of it afterward very negligently.</p>
            <p>For many courteous natures are as ſoft wax, ſooner able to receive the impreſſion of an <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi> but leſs able to retain it. Again, a more heroical nature is as harder wax, not ſo ſoon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, as keeping the print being made.</p>
            <p>As a furious or phreneticall brain can by no means away with him that ſhall lay hands on him, though it were for his profit; ſo, ſo long as we are in impatience, we perhaps may ſuffer no man to ſpeak unto us, though it be for our good; but the lethargie of our mind being cured, wee marvell at our former impatience, and are ready to ſhew our ſelves thankfull to him that would have a care to draw us out of ſuch a ſin.</p>
            <p>Therefore we ought not to faint or be weary of well ſpeaking, though ſucceſſe be not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to our preſent expectation.</p>
            <p>Mans pleaſure preſently is not to be ſatisfied; but Gods pleaſure patiently to bee attended, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. In which place as the Apoſtle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades to patience towards oppoſers, ſo alſo to inſtruct thoſe whom we reprove for ſin.</p>

Hazard of <hi>Suſpition</hi> from others, inaſmuch as we commonly gheſs at a mans inclination, by the diſpoſition of his company: Birds of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, moſt commonly will flock together. <hi>Noſcitur ex alin, qui non cognoſcitur ex ſe.</hi> The Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans enquiring after the behaviour of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, demanded very wiſely, with what play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes they were linked; not doubting, but that they would be like to ſuch whoſe fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they fancied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amicitiae ut pares quaerunt, ita &amp; faciunt:</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as it ſeeks, ſo it makes men alike in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Wherefore this is one certainly, and that not a little one, when daily, familiarly, delightfully, we converſe with notorious ſwearers, without any minde, heart, conſcience, to reprove them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond hazard is of <hi>Infection,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſince ſuch is the corruption of our nature, and nature of our corruption, that if the good and bad meet, the good is rather ſoyled by the bad, then the bad any way bettered by the good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Commiſti ſunt inter gentes,</hi> they were mingled amongſt the heathen, ſaith <hi>David</hi> of the people of God: and what was the iſſue? <hi>They learned their works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we be companions of Oſtriches, wee ſhall favour of their wildneſſe, as they who ſleep with Dogges, ſhall ſwarme with Fleas.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Corah</hi> did but kindle the fire of conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and preſently two hundred and fiftie Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains brought ſticks to increaſe it: ſo venemous is wickednes, that one dram of it is able to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the whole lump of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Sin among men, like the rot among ſheep, is of a catching and infectious quality; many have fallen into the faſhion of ſwearing out of the ill practice of <hi>Swearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an hard matter for the Soule not to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe vices, unto which the eyes and eares are invited.</p>
            <p>Swallowes would not flie within <hi>Thebes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their walls were ſo often beſieged: Let not men put on wings to flie into the company of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115434:85"/>thoſe men whoſe manners are corrupted, for fear both of corruption and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why our Saviour would not give that Diſciple leave to <hi>goe bury his dead Father,</hi> was, (as ſome judge) leſt his unbeleeving kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who would be preſent at his Fathers fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſhould corrupt him again, and ſo he ſhould die with them.</p>
            <p>Bad men keep others from goodneſſe, as thoſe dead carkaſſes did the Raven from <hi>Noabs</hi> Ark.</p>
            <p>From theſe let us run, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did from his Rod turned into a Serpent.</p>
            <p>For if with the Iſraelites we joyne our ſelves to <hi>Baal-Peor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 25.2, 3.</note> to the company of ſwaggering <hi>Swearers,</hi> we will eat the offerings of the dead, and bow down to their gods.</p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Mezentius</hi> the Tyrant, <hi>Corpora corporibus jungebat mortua vivis,</hi> hee bound the dead and the living together; but the dead did not revive by the living, the living putrefied ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of the dead.</p>
            <p>The freſh waters running into the Sea, doe not ſweeten it, but are made brackiſh by the ſame.</p>
            <p>Even in Paradiſe the woman, whom God himſelfe gave to man, being infected by the Serpent, infects the man, and that at the firſt aſſault; And ſhall any man now, being ſhut out of Paradiſe, and ſtript of thoſe ſupernaturall helps and graces wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> was inveſted, think himſelfe more able to reſiſt then hee? No, no,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Evill words corrupt good manners,</hi> much more doe blaſphemous horrid oathes.</p>
            <p>The long playing of the Cannon, batters the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115434:85"/>Wall, and a continuall dropping pierceth the ſtone. <hi>Peter</hi> by ſtanding long by a fires ſide in <hi>Caiaphas</hi> Hall, is dangerouſly infected. <hi>Joſeph</hi> living in <hi>Pharaobs</hi> Court, is at length taught and brought to ſweare by the life of <hi>Pharaob</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hearing their Parents to ſweare ſo oft, learn to be perfect in ſwearing, before they can go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; and take Gods name in vain, before they can rightly tell, or pronounce their own.</p>
            <p>The Phyſitians rule touching perſons infected with the plague, is good to be obſerved towards perſons preſumptuouſly remaining in this ſinne, <hi>Cito, longe, tarde:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now the plague is not more contagious then the <hi>Swearers</hi> are; the plague doth not more infect the aire, then the wicked <hi>Swearers</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and places among whom they live.</p>

            <p>The third hazard is of <hi>Malediction:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For as the bleſſing of God falls many times upon a whole ſocietie for one mans goodneſſe, as it did with all that ſailed with <hi>Paul</hi> for his ſake,<note place="margin">Act. 27.

            </p>
            <p>God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Iſrael, ſaying, <hi>Get you up from about the Tabernacle of Corah, Dathan and Abiram; and Moſes</hi> did ſpeak,<note place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Depart, I pray you, from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of thoſe wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, leſt yee be conſumed in their ſiunes.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was no ſooner obeyed by their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſpeech ended, but the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was preſently inflicted.<note place="margin">Verſ. 31.</note> 
               <hi>The earth clave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder that was under them, and ſwallowed them up, their houſes, goods, and all that appertained to them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 34.</note> And what did the reſt of the Iſraelites do? <hi>And they that were round about them, fled at the cry of them; for they ſaid, Let us bee gone quickly, lest the earth ſwallow us up alſo.</hi> Surely they made a good application, leſt God ſeeing their connivence at their ſinnes, by their abode in the place, ſhould
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115434:86"/>have made them alſo to have ſhared in the like puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Seeing many horrible blaſphemers have been taken away (as the <hi>Coruwall</hi> Gentleman, the <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> Serving-man) in the midſt of their ſwearing; the one crying, <hi>Horſe and man and all to the Devill,</hi> the bloud of the other breaking out of all his members, as he ſwore <hi>by Gods bloud; Michael</hi> the Jewiſh Rabbine breaking his neck, even in the act of his blaſphemy; and the Courtier at <hi>Mansfeild</hi> carried away by the Devill in the midſt of his oathes; (as before was ſhewed) why may not we feare the like judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon ſuch, that are like ſwearers, &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them (we approving their curſes by our ſilence at their ſwearing, and delighting in their company) may juſtly feare to ſhare in ſome part of their puniſhment, if not in ſoule, yet in body; if not in the next life to our deſtruction, yet in this life for other mens admonition.</p>
            <p>See (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3.13.) what the ſin of <hi>Korah,</hi>

So ſay our ruffian-like ſwearers, You take too much upon you, all are as holy as you your ſelfe; <hi>Wilt thou make thy ſelfe altogether a Prince,</hi> and a Ruler <hi>over us?</hi> ver. 13. The ſayings of theſe in contempt of admoniſhing, beſides their ſwearing, are very fearfull, ſinfull.</p>

               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:115434:87"/>Their company then cannot be ſo profitable, ſhould not be pleaſing.

            <p>The Apoſtles meaning is, that ſometimes wee ſhall have a lawfull occaſion to converſe and commerce with wicked perſons, but that muſt onely be, when a lawfull calling doth warrant us, and then muſt wee <hi>ſhine as lights in the midſt of a crooked generation,</hi> that we by our ſilence be not infected with them, but they by our diſlike of their ſinne reclaimed from the ſame.</p>

            <p>If God denounce war againſt any man, all the creatures are ready to ſerve him in their courſe.</p>

            <p>How canſt thou taſte the fruit of that Vine, which thou never plantedſt?</p>

            <p>Thoſe that the Lord proclaims war againſt, as rebels;<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.1, 2, 3.</note> as here he doth againſt Swearers, the leaſt that we can do (if we would ſhew our ſelves good and faithfull Subjects) is to profeſſe that we may not, we muſt not ſuffer them unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; or, if it be in our power, unpuniſhed: in as much as to lodge a known Traitor in our houſe, or to give him countenance, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe familiarly with him, and then to give out, that we carry as ſound and loyall a heart to our Soveraigne as the beſt, is a matter that rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves laughter then beliefe.</p>

            <p>As the Thunderbolt falls with the danger of few, but with the feare of all: So, <hi>poena ad paucos, metus ad omnes,</hi> the ſhame and puniſhment rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth but to a few, but the feare of the ſhame and puniſhment unto all:<note place="margin">Etſi melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res allicit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, plure; tamen cogit timor.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For the better are directed by love, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are corrected by ſhame or feare.</p>
            <p>A man that ſtands by and ſees another ſeared,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115434:96"/>launced, beheaded, hanged, is thereby made more carefull of his own health and life.</p>
            <p>The men addicted to ſwearing, ſeeing others ſmart by puniſhment, or aſhamed by reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are made more wary how they blaſpheme the great, fearfull, and glorious name of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third motive is from Diſcredit.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 3. From the Diſcredit.</note> It is a ſhrewd ſigne that a man is addicted to ſwearing himſelfe, when he gives way to others without check or controll. And it is a generall rule, He that heareth the ſwearer quietly where he may reprove him, he is become guilty of the ſame offence. To ſweare, or to liſten to ſwearing, which of theſe two is the worſt, cannot eaſily be defined; the one having the Devill in his tongue, the other in his eare: and that quickly enters in at the eare, that cleaves as faſt to the ſoule as skin and bones together.</p>
            <p>It is the receiver that makes the thiefe, and a faire countenance, and open eare to ſwearing, that makes and maintaines the ſwearer.</p>
            <p>The ground hereof is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. laſt verſe:<note place="margin">Rom 1. laſt verſe.</note> 
               <hi>Not onely they which commit ſuch things, are worthy of death; but they alſo that doe conſent to them that doe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſent is direct or indirect; direct by adviſing and enticing to doe a thing, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending or delighting in it being done: indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, when a man reproves or reſiſts it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his power ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, wouldeſt thou be free from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reproofe, and ſo from bearing of ſhame? let thy little unruly tongue be bridled, and ſet a
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115434:97"/>watch before the doore of thy lippes, <hi>Diſce non libenter dieere, quod non vis libenter audire:</hi> ſpeak not that wickedly, which thou wilt not heare reproved willingly: for hee that ſpeakes what he ſhould not, muſt heare that hee would not, and good reaſon: for elſe the hearer to pleaſe him, ſhould diſcredit himſelfe, and diſhonour his maker by his ſilence.</p>
            <p>The fourth motive from the Danger:<note place="margin">4. Motive from the Danger.</note> The ſwearer not reproved, or puniſhed, his ſinne is made the ſinne of thoſe that ſhould reprove or puniſh the ſame.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Perk.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 8. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wayes how men doe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with other mens ſins. <hi>See ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, l.</hi> 1 <hi>p.</hi> 1.

            </p>
            <p>They by and for neglect thereof, doe draw down the wrath of God upon a whole land: God ſeeing none reprove, or by ſharp courſes ſtrive againſt this ſinne, comes downe himſelfe to take the matter into his owne hands, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a juſt and ſharp <hi>controverſie with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the land, the beaſts of the field, and fiſhes of the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why with the inhabitants of the land? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>qui non vetat peccare cum poteſt, jubet:</hi> hee that doth not reſtrain a man (when it is his duty, and lies in his power) doth command him to ſinne; he that hinders not, doth further him to ſinne. <hi>Judex damnatur dum nocens abſolvitur;</hi> looſing the guilty, he ties faſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>I may invert the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly one no man, neither be partaker with other mens ſinnes,</hi> lay ſuddenly the words of admonition to oathes tranſgreſſion, leſt thou be partaker of their ſinnes, leſt by thy ſecret ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, thou be partaker of their open ſinfulneſſe,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115434:97"/>leſt by thy not reproving, thou bee as though thou hadſt ſworn. Though their ſinne through ſwiftneſſe hath taken flight into the eare, yet let it not by connivence take footing in the heart. Apply ſoule-ſaving reproofe as often to his oathes, as hee doth ſoule-killing oathes to thy eare, that ſo preventing his ſinnes infection, thou mayſt eſcape his ſinnes malediction. <hi>Hee that ſaith to the wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 24.24.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe,</hi> Prov. 24.24.</p>
            <p>They then that hearing Gods name blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſwearing, his creatures abuſed by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Sabbaths prophaned by dancing, his word contemned by peoples abſenting, his poor ſtarved by not relieving them, and hath his mouth muzled, lips ſealed, tongue tied, doe in a manner by their ſilence ſay they are righteous, and do approve their courſes;<note place="margin">Pro. 17.15.</note> and ſo by <hi>juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them in their ſins, are an <hi>abomination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 17. whereas by their connivencie they ſeek and think to have credit and love with men, they make themſelves odious both to God and man.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee many ſeverall motives why the ſwearer muſt be reproved; becauſe of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Caution; as alſo the Diſeredit and Danger that is conſequently to enſue, doe call all upon us for the performing this duty.</p>
            <p>Now thou that heareſt or readeſt theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, ſuffer, oh ſuffer them not to be as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpilt upon the ground, or ſtones caſt againſt the wind; but being free thy ſelfe from this ſinne, by the meanes propoſed in the fourth
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115434:98"/>uſe, labour to make others under thy roofe and regiment, to bee free by the motives alledged in this fifth and laſt uſe, that thou mayſt bee wiſe, not for thy ſelfe alone, but for others alſo. For be thou well aſſured, it is in vain for thee being a Parent, a Maſter, or an Houſholder, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from ſwearing, unleſſe others under thee abſtain alſo: The goodneſſe of a Maſter, Parent, or Ruler, profiteth not ſo much in the right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Family, as the wickedneſſe of a ſwearer deſtroyeth. It is well when one plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and another watereth; but it is evill when one planteth and another plucketh up.</p>
            <p>Yet (notwithſtanding all that hath or may be ſpoken) our people ſtill practice what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet propheſied,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.4. <hi>Let no man ſtrive or reprove one another,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged why men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove not, or puniſh ſwearers.</note> no, though it be his brother: For this heaven-daring ſin, to a man of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to range him into order, it is as burning coles caſt upon flax, it ſets on fire within or without, his heart being kindled within, that breaks forth into ſome of theſe ſeverall flames at his mouth.</p>

            <p>Naturall motions gather ſtrength in moving: do thou begin this duty, whether of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or puniſhment (as thy calling and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall round thee in the eare) and then ſee whether, though thou find ſome rubs, oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and gain-ſayings at the firſt, yet the further thou wadeſt in this duty, the more eaſie thou ſhalt find the paſſage, and the means more ready to compaſſe thy intended purpoſe.</p>

            <p>They by this thy diligence may be converted, and thou ſhine gloriouſly in heaven; thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, canſt not have thy duty diſcharged, or ever live comfortably on earth.</p>

            <p>It is wonder, that the imputation of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſwearer ſhould be ſo odious, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice ſo frequent amongſt men, wherefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem to be as thou art, or elſe to be as thou wouldeſt ſeem: either make care and conſcience,

            <p>Whereas thou ſayeſt, thou ſhalt be thought to ſeek their ſhame and thy own praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in reproving ſwearers: Be thou therefore ſure that thy reproofes bee in ſincerity, and not in bravery; Doe not think to grace thy ſelfe by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing of others, or to make thy ſelfe white by ſhewing their blackneſſe. Goe not about to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe thee eredit and opinion of religion in the world, by raiſing it out of the dunghill of thy neighbours corruptions, but do it w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> all ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and inward compaſſion of ſpirit, that thy love firſt appearing, thy labour may not be loſt.</p>
            <p>Thou then (howſoever thou be cenſured by men) mayſt be aſſured in thy owne conſcience, (that will ſpeak more for thee then the whole world can doe againſt thee) that thou ſeekeſt not the praiſe which is of men, which vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but that which is of God, which abideth for ever.</p>

               <p>The Romans ſo highly eſteemed of Faith in all their publique affaires, that in their City they had a Temple dedicated to it, and did (for more reverence ſake) offer ſacrifices to the Image of Faith.</p>
               <p>Hence it was, that <hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> chief Captain of the Roman army againſt the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115434:106"/>was ſo highly commended of all men, becauſe, when he was overcome, taken priſoner, and ſent to Rome, hee did only for his oath ſake which he had ſworn, return to his enemy, albeit he knew what grievous torments were provided for him at his return.</p>
               <p>Others alſo that came with him, though they were intreated, and by their parents, wives, allies inſtantly urged, not to return to <hi>Hannibals</hi> camp, could in no wiſe be moved thereunto: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Romans their friends did not accord to their proffered conditions, therefore they would perform their oathes to the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians their enemies.</p>
               <p>But two of the ten (for ſo many were they) falſified their oath, and did not return, yet were they among all men accounted and condemned for cowards, and faint-hearted traytors, in ſo much, that the Cenſors noted them with infamy for the fact: whereat they took ſuch grief and inward ſorrow, that being weary of their lives, they ſlew themſelves. Thus the Heathen not only teach by precept, (<hi>Cicero lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Offic.</hi>) but alſo performed by practice (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Offic.</hi>) that an oath is ſo ſacred, that it is to be kept with our greateſt enemies, and moſt wicked people.</p>

               <p>By all which examples (becauſe examples moſt move in every matter) wee have ſeen and may learn to beleeve how greatly God doth deteſt, how ſeverely and ſuddenly he doth puniſh all thoſe who by this fearfull ſin of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, doe take Gods name in vaine, ſwearing that to be true which they know to be falſe, and helliſhly breaking their vow and promiſe, whereto ſo holily they bound themſelves by oath.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115434:112"/>before the world, for the goods ſake, and the Father is reckoned before God and his holy Angels, a fire-brand in hell. The ſonne is Lord of many poſſeſſions, the father is a wretch and hath nothing. The ſonne is repleniſhed with dainties, joy and pleaſure, the father is filled full of bitter ſorrowes and intolerable torments. The ſonne ſingeth, playeth, danceth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth merry, the father weepeth, ſorroweth, and wiſheth himſelfe never to have been born.

               <p>Mark what <hi>Claudianus</hi> the heathen Poet concludeth touching perjury:

                     <l>Has eadem nati lingua refudit opes.</l>
                  </q> The perjuries of the Father eſcaping puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this world, fall upon the ſonne, and look what riches the tongue of the deceitfull father hath gathered together, even the very ſame hath the tongue of the ſonne paid home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and waſt fully ſpent.</p>
               <p>The Jurers or witneſſes (through raſhneſſe and want of admonition by the Magiſtrate) are ſuddenly brought to this fearfull ſinne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juty, for want of ſober advice and mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration through haſt, and in affection to the one party, are prone to ſlide into this dangerons pit. Whereas (at the taking of their oath) they
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115434:113"/>ſhould be exhorted ſo uncorruptly to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, to deale ſo truly and uprightly, and to give ſo juſt a verdict, even as though it ſhould be preſented and offered up to the high and everlaſting Judge Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Biſhops and Paſtors, that promiſe faithfulnes to be earneſt preachers, to ſet forth Gods word, and live according to the ſame; if they doe not labour in the harveſt of Gods word, doe not lead an honeſt and vertuous life, they are forſworne, and ſhall not be held guiltleſſe.</p>
               <p>The man and wife that promiſe faith and troth to each other, that they will in all eſtates and extremities, lean each to other, the man to love his wife as himſelfe, and hold himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with her; <hi>the woman reverently to feare and obey her husband in the Lord;</hi> if they breake this promiſe, and one delight not in another; but each ſeek after ſtrange fleſh, they are then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn, and ſhall not eſcape the puniſhment of perjury.</p>
               <p>The ſubiects that promiſe obedience and

               <p>As for all Knights of the Poſt, falſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearers, who (like <hi>Putiphars</hi> wife) doe onely ſhew the garments of honeſt men to prove their diſhoneſt cauſe, I wiſh them no other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then that which <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon two of his ſubiects, in whom hee ſaw no hope of grace. <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iſocrates</hi> the Orator, gives an excellent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all thoſe who for the leaſt advantage ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to take an oath. Take an oath (ſaith he) that is put unto thee for two cauſes, either that thou mayſt deliver thy ſelfe from a filthy crime, or that thou mayſt preſerve thy friends that are in perill and danger: but for money ſee thou ſweare by no God, although thou ſweare righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: For to ſome thou ſhalt ſeem to forſwear thy ſelfe, and to ſome to bee deſirous of money. Surely a divine ſaying of an heathen man, and worthy to bee written in Marble and braſſe, yea in the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if the thought of the ſhame before men, will not yet let thee feare, and danger of the puniſhment from God, reſtrain us from this ſo dreadfull and damnable a ſin; <hi>Foelices faciant ſi aliena pericula cautos,</hi> It is well for us if the

               <p>Let no man think that God will leave that unpuniſhed in us, which he hath not pardoned in other, that had not ſo many examples of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment before them, as are before us.

               <p>And ſo I paſſe to the laſt of the wayes that at firſt I propoſed, whereby Gods name is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vaine, to wit, by curſing, wherein I dare paſſe my word, I will be very brief, leſt this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that at firſt was intended but a narrow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to bee paſſed through in the ſpace of an houre, ſhould ſwell into a wide Ocean, even not to be ſailed over in the length of a Summers day.</p>

                  <hi>Wierus</hi> reports, concerning an Hoſt in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> a countrey of <hi>Almaigne,</hi> who being queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the Magiſtrate for detaining certain money which a traveller, a Souldier, delivered to his Hoſteſſe to keep, impudently (againſt his own knowledge) denied the ſame, wiſhing the Devill might take him if hee had it. Then the Devill there pleading in the habit of a ſubtile Lawyer, in a blew cap, in the behalfe of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and reckoning up every circumſtance in the action; yea the very place where they had hid the money: hearing (I ſay) thoſe words, (let the Devill take me) looking for no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, leſt pleading, and fell to lay hold on the Hoſt, and carried him out of the Seſſions houſe; hoiſted him into the aire ſo high, that hee was never after ſeen, or heard of to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Thus was Gods iudgements fully manifeſted upon the forſworn and curſing Hoſt, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment of all the beholders, and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers innocencie cleared (for he by the Hoſt was accuſed and impriſoned for aſſaulting to breake and rob his houſe) and ſo ſtrangely from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the law delivered.</p>
               <p>The ſame author reports what happened in <hi>Megalapole</hi> neer to <hi>Voildſtat,</hi> in the time of the celebration of the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, <hi>Anno</hi> 1051. The people being ſet on drinking and carrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a woman in the company commonly named the Devill in her oathes, till the Devil being ſo oft called upon carried her through the gate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115434:117"/>into the aire before them all, and hanging a while in the aire, they found her fallen dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground without the town.</p>
               <p>About the yeare 1551. there lived in a City of Savoy, one that was a monſtrous ſwearer and curſer, who put many good men to much fruitleſſe pains, not ſo much as liſtning to their admonitions, much leſſe reforming his maners. It fell out that the peſtilence being in the Citie, he was infected with it, and therefore withdrew himſelfe with his wife and a kinſwoman, into a Garden which he had; neither yet in this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity did the Miniſters forſake him, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhorted him to repent, and laid before his eyes his faults and offences, to the end to bring him into the right way. But he was ſo farre from being touched and moved with theſe godly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, that he ſtrove to harden himſelf more and more in his ſinnes. Therefore on a day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening forward his owne miſhap, as hee was ſwearing, denying God, and giving himſelfe to the Devill, and calling for him with vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, behold even the Devill himſelfe ſnatched him up ſuddenly, and heaved him up into the aire, his wife and kinſwoman looking on, and ſeeing him flie over their heads. Being thus ſwiftly tranſported, his cap tumbled from his head, and was found at <hi>Roſne,</hi> but himſelfe no man couldever after ſet eye upon. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate advertiſed hereof, came to the place whence he was taken, to bee better informed of the truth, taking witneſſe of the two women touching that which they had ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:115434:118"/>Such judgements doubtleſſe are made manifeſt to ſtrike a feare and terror into the heart of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curſer, that are ſo inſpired with Satan, that they cannot ſpeake but they muſt name him, even him that is an enemy both to God and man, and like a roaring Lion runs to and fro, ſeeking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mans deſtruction. Yet too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in any diſquietneſſe of mind, or anger of body, call upon him for aid, when it were needfull to call upon God, having both a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment ſo to doe, and a promiſe adjoyned, that he will help us in our extremities, if by true repentance and hearty prayer we approach unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodor Beza</hi> reports unto us in his 26. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Paſſion, a notable hiſtory of his own knowledge, of the ſeverity of Gods judgments upon a curſer.</p>
               <p>I knew (ſaith hee) in <hi>France</hi> a man of good parts, well inſtructed in religion, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a family, who in his anger curſing, and bidding the Devill take one of his children, had preſently his wiſh: for the child was poſſeſſed immediatly with a ſpirit; from which, though by the fervent and continuall prayer of the Church, he was at length releaſed, yet ere hee had fully recovered his health, he died.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1557. the day before good Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, at <hi>Forchenum,</hi> a Citie in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bamburg,</hi> there was a certain crooked Prieſt, both in minde and body, through age and evill conditions, that could not go but upon crutches, yet would needs be lifted up into the Pulpit to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115434:118"/>make a Sermon, his Text was out of the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the eleventh chapter, touching the Lords Supper; whereat taking occaſion to commend the Papiſticall errours, and the Maſſe, hee uſed theſe and ſuch like blaſphemous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>O Paul, Paul, if thy doctrine touching the receiving of the Sacraments in both kinds, bee true, and if it bee a wicked thing to receive it otherwiſe, then would the Devill might take me.</hi> And (turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe to the people) <hi>if the Popes doctrine concerning this poynt be falſe, than I am the Davils boud-ſlave, neither doe I feare to pawn my ſoule upon it.</hi> Theſe and many other blaſphemous ſpeeches he uſed, till the Devill came indeed, transformed into the ſhape of a tall man, black and terrible, ſending before him ſuch a fearfull noyſe, and roaring wind, that the people ſuppoſed that the Church would have fallen on their heads. But he not able to hurt the reſt, tooke away the old Prieſt, being his devoted bond ſlave, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo farre, that hee was never after heard of.</p>
               <p>At another time after, the like noyſe was heard in the ſame Church, whiles they were baptizing an infant; and all this for the abominable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and blaſphemy of the prophane Popiſh Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author <hi>Fincelius,</hi> in his ſecond book of Miracles, reports of a certain man living in <hi>Helvetia, Anno</hi> 1556. who earned his living by making clean rough and foule linnen againſt the Sunne, who entred into a Tavern, taſted ſo much the grapes, that his wits were drowned, and his
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115434:119"/>tongue ſo inſpired, that he vomited out terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble curſes againſt himſelfe and others; amongſt the reſt, he wiſhed that if ever he went into the field to his old occupation, the Devill might come and break his neck. But when ſleep had conquered drink, and ſobriety reſtored his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hee went again to his trade, remembring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his late words, but regarding them not. Howbeit the Devill, to ſhew his double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, attended on him at his appointed houre in the fields, in the likeneſſe of a bigge ſwarthy man, and asked him if he remembred his promiſe and vow which he had made the day before, and if it were not lawfull for him to break his neck, and withall ſtrook the poore man (trembling for feare) over the ſhoulders, that his feet and his hands preſently dried up, ſo that he lay there not able to ſtirre, till by the help of men he was carried home, the Lord not giving the Devill ſo much power over him, as he wiſhed himſelfe, but yet permitted him to plague him on this ſort, for his amendment and our example.</p>
               <p>The three that falſly accuſed <hi>Narciſſus</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, wiſhing that if their ſayings and ſwearings were not true, they might the one conſume with ſome fearfull diſeaſe, the other that he might be burned, the third that he might bee blind, had their wiſhes, according to their deſerts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as before touching perjurers, you have heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> Earle <hi>Schwarthurg,</hi> through a corrupt cuſtome, uſed commonly to wiſh, that hee might be drowned in a privie. And as he wiſhed, ſo it
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115434:119"/>happened unto him, he was ſo ſerved, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered at S. <hi>Peters</hi> Monaſtery in <hi>Erford, Anno</hi> 1148.</p>
               <p>The like befell a young Courtier at <hi>Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> whoſe cuſtome was in any earneſt aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſay, <hi>The Devill take me, if it be not true,</hi> or <hi>if it be not ſo.</hi> The Devill indeed took him while he ſlept, and threw him out of an high window, where, albeit by the good providence of God, he took no hurt that was great, yet he learned by experience to bridle his tongue from all ſuch curſed ſpeeches: this being but a taſte of Gods wrath that is to fall upon ſuch wretches that live and die in their ſins.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Oſter</hi> a village in the Dutchy of <hi>Megalapole,</hi> there happened a moſt ſtrange and fearfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample upon a woman, that gave her ſelfe to the Devill both body and ſoule, and uſed moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible curſings and oathes, both againſt her ſelfe and others; which deteſtable manner of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as at many other times, ſo eſpecially ſhee ſhewed it at a marriage at the foreſaid village on S. <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> day, the whole people exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her to leave off her accuſtomed impietie: But ſhe nothing bettered, continued her courſe til all the company were ſet at dinner, and very merry: Then lo the Devill having got full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her, came in perſon, and tranſported her into the aire before them all, with moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible out-cries and roarings, and in that ſort carried her round about the town, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were ready to die with feare; and by and by tore her in foure pieces, leaving in foure
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115434:120"/>ſeverall high wayes a quarter, that all that came by, might be witneſſes of her puniſhment, and then returning to the marriage, threw her bowels upon the Table, before the Major of the Towne, with theſe words: <hi>Behold theſe diſhes of meat belong to thee, whom the like deſtruction wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for, if thou doeſt not amend thy wicked life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reporters of this hiſtory were <hi>John Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the Miniſter of the ſaid town, with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor himſelfe, and the whole inhabitants, being deſirous to have it made known unto the world for example ſake.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Luthers</hi> conferences wee read, that divers noble men, ſtriving together at a horſe-race, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their courſe, <hi>The Devill take the laſt.</hi> Now the laſt was a horſe that brake looſe, whom the Devill hoiſted into the aire, and took cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fincelius</hi> records concerning a man not farre from <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> that provided a ſumptuous feaſt, a ſupper, and invited many gueſts unto it; who at the time appointed refuſing to come, he in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and chafe cried, <hi>Then let all the Devils in bell come:</hi> neither was his wiſh frivolous, for a number of theſe helliſh Fiends came forthwith, whom hee not diſcerning from men, came to welcome and entertain; and perceiving in ſtead of fingers, clawes, all diſmayed, hee ran out of thedoores with his wife, and left none in the houſe, but an infant, with a foole ſitting by the fire, whom the Devil had no power to hurt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any man elſe, but the goodly ſupper which they quickly made away withall, and ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:115434:120"/>It is generally known at <hi>Oundell,</hi> a Towne in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> amongſt all that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. with the party, namely, <hi>William Hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> how he uſed in his earneſt talk, to curſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on this manner, <hi>If it be not true, then let God ſend a viſible confuſion upon me.</hi> Now hee wanted not his wiſh: for hee came to a viſible confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being (for calling himſelf Chriſt, and Judge of the earth) hanged on a Gibbet in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> 33, of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches are too common in the mouthes of many people, <hi>The Devill take thee for thy labour. If I doe this, or his, God conſume me body and ſoule: the plague or the pox take or rot thee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> before <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other learned men, a woman whoſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was poſſeſſed with a ſpirit, confeſſed that by her curſe that plague was fallen upon her: for being angry at a time, ſhe bade the Devill take her; and ſhe had no ſooner ſpoke the word, but hee took her indeed, and poſſeſſed her after a ſtrange ſort.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Neoburg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> another woman in her anger curſed her ſonne, ſaying and praying ſhe might never ſee him return alive: And the ſame day the young man bathing himſelfe in water, was drowned, and never returned to his mother alive, according to her wicked wiſh.</p>
               <p>At the Citie of <hi>Aſtorga,</hi> another woman deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Devil in hell to fetch her ſonne out of her preſence. The boy at laſt through feare, about ten of the clock the ſame night, went out
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115434:121"/>into a little court behind the houſe; from which he was ſuddenly hoiſted up into the aire, by men in ſhew of grim countenance, great ſtature, and loathſome geſture, but indeed cruell Fiends of Hell, and that with ſuch ſwiftneſſe, as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe after confeſſed, that it was not poſſible to his ſeeming, for any bird in the world to flie ſo faſt: And lighting downe among certaine mountaines of buſhes and briers, was trailed through the thickeſt of them, and ſo torne and rent in his cloathes, hands, face, feet, and almoſt in all his body. At laſt the boy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring God, and beſeeching him for help and aſſiſtance, the cruell Fiends brought him back again through the aire, and put him in at a little window into a chamber of his fathers houſe, where after much ſearch and griefe for him, he was found in that pittifull plight, and almoſt beſides himſelfe. And thus though they had not power to deprive him of life, as they had done the former, yet God ſuffered them to afflict the parents in the ſonne, for the good both of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and ſonne, if they belonged unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>But above all this, is moſt ſtrange which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in a town in <hi>Miſnia,</hi> the eleventh of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1552. where a cholerick father ſeeing his ſonne ſlack about his buſineſſe, wiſhed he might never ſtir from that place. It was no ſooner ſaid but done; his ſon ſtuck faſt in the place, neither by any means poſſible could be removed, no not ſo much as to ſet or bend his body, till by the prayers of the faithfull, his pains were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what mitigated, though not remitted; three
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115434:121"/>yeares he continued ſtanding with a poſt at his back for his eaſe, and foure yeares ſitting, at the end whereof he died, nothing weakned in his underſtanding, but profeſſing the faith, and not doubting of his ſalvation in Chriſt Jeſus. When he was demanded at any time how hee did, hee anſwered moſt uſually, that hee was faſtned of God, and that it was not in man, but in Gods mercy for him to be releaſed.</p>
               <p>The ſtrangeneſſe of the example ſhould not diſcredit the truth hereof, ſeeing we read how <hi>Lots</hi> wife was turned into a pillar of ſalt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> And <hi>Corah</hi> with his company ſwallowed up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> Happy are we if the puniſhments inflicted upon others, doe make us repent, and leave our own known fins, and all ſuch bitter curſings, &amp; fearfull imprecations againſt our ſelves and others, ſuch as are theſe, <hi>I pray God I may never ſtirre;</hi> or, <hi>I may rot alive;</hi> or, <hi>my eyes may drop out of my bead, I would I might never ſpeak more if it bee not true;</hi> or, <hi>I may ſink into the earth;</hi> or, <hi>that theſe hands may never open again;</hi> or, <hi>the Devill then take me, if I do this;</hi> or, <hi>I pray God this bread or drink may be my poyſon;</hi> or, <hi>I may never enjoy good by any peny that ever I ſhal have;</hi> or being offended with others, <hi>The pox take thee, the plague conſume thee, a murraine on thee, the Devill fetch thee alive;</hi> or, <hi>would to God thou never hadſt been born, or ſeen the Sunne;</hi> or, <hi>I pray God I may never ſee thee again,</hi> with a world of ſuch fearfull, ſinfull, direfull wiſhes.</p>

If the oath he directed to God in the mind of the ſwearer, under the name of the creature, it is taken for lawfull among the Papiſts, and many Proteſtants: But Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.34. findeth no Scripture to warrant this kind of ſwearing by the creatures with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to God in the minde of him that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, induced by <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <p>If a man might ſweare by the creatures, and conceale the name of God, it would diminiſh his Majeſty and Authority, and much deceit might beuſed: for the ſwearer might ſay, that he ſware not by God, but onely uſed an obteſtation by the creatures.</p>
               <p>Read <hi>Perkins</hi> his anſwers to the objections on <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and in Caſes of Conſcience, where this queſtion ſomewhat largely is by him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſſed.</p>
               <p>Whether an oath made by Creatures, Idols,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 16.</note> or falſe Gods, is to be performed.</p>
               <p>It is: Hence <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Hee that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115434:129"/>falſly by a ſtone, is perjured. Though that be not holy by which he ſweareth, yet the Lord is holy before whom hee ſweareth. Though the ſtone heareth him not ſpeake, yet God will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him if he deceive.</p>
               <p>Though it be not lawful to ſwear by falſe gods, or Idols, yet whoſoever hath ſworn by them, as by true Gods, he is bound to performe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; not for the Idols ſake, but for Gods ſake before whom he ſweareth; not becauſe they are true Gods indeed, but becauſe they are ſo in the ſwearers opinion. Therefore the Turk ſwearing by <hi>Mabomet,</hi> is perjured if he doe not perform his promiſe. So are the Papiſts, ſwearing by the Idoll of the Maſſe, if they doe not performe their promiſe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iacob</hi> made a promiſe and covenant with <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> ſwore by the Idols of <hi>Nabor, Iacob</hi> accepted of the oath, though ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unto him in the name of a falſe God, which he would not have done, had it been no oath at all.</p>
               <p>A poore man being in extreame want, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth of the uſurer upon intereſt: it is ſinne in the uſurer to take it, but it is not ſo in the poort man, who is compelled by the uſurer to give it. Thus the poore man doth uſe well the iniquity of the uſurer. So is it in an oath, a godly man may well uſe and take benefit by the wicked oathes of Idolaters, ſo farre forth as they ſhall ſerve for the ratifying and confirming of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full covenants.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe it is a leſſer offence to ſweare by
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115434:129"/>the falſe God truly, then to ſweare by the true God falſly: it is a ſin to lie, a double ſin to ſwear and lie.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is unlawfull for a private man to impoſe ſuch an oath for his owne private reſpect and gaine:<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> for we ought rather to loſe any worldly benefit, then by ſuch an oath to ſuffer God to be diſhonoured, and our neighbour to loſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> accounteth ſuch a perſon worſe then a murtherer, becauſe the murtherer killeth but the body, this the ſoule, yea, two ſoules at once, his whom hee provoketh to ſweare, and his own.</p>
               <p>Doeſt thou know that to be true which thou affirmeſt, and that falſe which thou avoucheſt, and yet urgeſt him to ſweare? Bohold, he ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, for ſweareth, and periſheth; and what haſt thou found hereby? yea, thou haſt loſt thy ſelf, who wouldſt no otherwiſe be ſatisfied, but by his deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Yet the Magiſtrate, if the execution of law and juſtice do ſo require, may put ſuch a one to his oath: for better it is that a private perſon ſhould periſh, then the publique adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of juſtice ſhould be hindred.</p>
               <p>Yet all other means for the finding out of the truth, are firſt to be uſed, and the party that is to ſwear, gravely to be admoniſhed of the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115434:130"/>of an oath, the heynonſneſſe of perjury, and the fearfulneſſe of the puniſhment at tending thereon, and ſo leave the party to himſelf and the event to God.</p>
               <p>Such light perſons, that ſeem by their evill courſes, to be void of all truth, and the fear of God, if they have ſworn, yet I think the Judge is to give little credit unto them; If the caſe did concerne himſelf hee would not much credit them. Whence pithy <hi>Parens</hi> upon thoſe words of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9.2. <hi>[I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt Jeſus, I lie not, my conſcience alſo bearing witneſſe]</hi> hath this obſervation: Take his oath that hath a good conſcience. As a prophane man makes no more account of his oathes then of a ſtraw, ſo ought the Judge to account of them, and never to urge ſuch to ſwear; for they will ſweare any thing.</p>
               <p>Whether an oath made to the Creator,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 21.</note> may be diſpenſable by the Creature.</p>
               <p>It may not: For in every lawfull oath there is not onely a bond between man and man,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> of one man to another, but alſo of man to God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if in the oath taken, man were onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to man, it might bee diſpenſed by man; but ſeeing the ſwearer is bound immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God himſelfe, hee cannot have releaſe from the Pope, or any other inferiour Biſhop, or creature. <hi>Thou ſhalt perform thy oathes.</hi> To whom? <hi>To the Lord, Matth.</hi> 5.33.</p>
               <p>That which God bindeth, no creature can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.6. When the Pope ſheweth himſelfe Antichriſt, in that hee challengeth
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115434:131"/>power to diſpenſe with a lawfull oath, made without error or deceit, of things honeſt and poſſible.</p>
               <p>Now that I may at length draw this worke off the Loome, and conclude, what letteth, but that the ſinner ſhould ſurceaſe by ſwearing, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing, and curſing, to take Gods Name in vain? conſidering the threats denounced in the Word, are ſo many, and plentifull, and the judgements inflicted upon them in the world, have been ſo vilible and fearfull. What is the cauſe they ſhould any longer ſtop their eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe verball and reall charmes, and hate to bee reformed? I cannot imagine what they can alledge, why ſentence preſently be not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon them, unleſſe they conceit, either that God will be more merciful unto them then Miniſters promiſe, by the many threats againſt theſe their vain, vile, and abominable impieties proclaimed; or that theſe threats are not the words of God, but the politicke traditions of men, to hold men in aw in regard of humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and worldly affaires.</p>
               <p>Indeed if theſe threats in the Scripture, and the whole Scripture it ſelfe, be not the word of God, there is ſome colour for them to continue in their ſins: But if the Scriptures bee the word of God, there is weighty cauſe why by the threats recorded in the ſame, they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſolve, now, even now, while it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to day, not to harden their hearts any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but to hearken to the voyce of the Lord, and ſuffer his word to reclaim them from theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115434:131"/>helliſh, dangerous, damnable ſinnes of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forſwearing, curſing.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe their laſt and lewd obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, concerning Gods mercifulneſſe, marke what the Lord ſpeaketh (<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19.) touching ſuch preſumptuous perſons, whoſe root beareth nothing but gall and wormwood, <hi>If it come to paſſe when ſuch a ſinner heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſſeth himſelfe in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walke in the imagination of my heart, thus adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt, the Lord will not ſpare him, but the Anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes written in this booke ſhall lie upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> certaine to beleeve, fearfull to heare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to feele and indure.</p>
               <p>Which being to all (ſave to Atheiſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) ſo true and fearfull, theſe ſwearers, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and perjured perſons, are ſo imboldned by long cuſtome in their ſinnes, that (when they heare their threats ſo many and grievous recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Law) they bluſh not to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the truth of the Scriptures themſelves, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Who can tell whether theſe ſayings and ſentences be the words of God, or no?</p>
               <p>Wherefore to convince them of this their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall conceit, that ſo if it be poſſible, they may be converted from theſe three vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſins; let them but reſolve but to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe enſuing arguments to have paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the innermoſt cloſets of their hearts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, that ſo as I began with the Titles of

               <p>Yet ſuch, O Lord, hath been the ignorance in our underſtanding, the hardneſſe of our hearts, the contempt of thy Word, and the neglect of thy threatnings, that we have not ſuffered thy precepts ſo to informe us, or thy menaces ſo to awaken us, as that wee have been reclaimed from this vaine, unprofitable, hell-hatched, heaven-daring, ſoule-killing, land-ſhaking impiety: Inſomuch that it is thy meere mercy that wee are not every moment for this very ſinne conſumed, ſince many ſuch ſinners have taſted of the certainty of thy judgements, even in this life, thou viſibly cauſing thy plagues to fall downe upon them even in the inſtant when their blaſphemies have been powred out againſt thee.</p>

               <p>Le us be ſparing in the uſe of aſſeverations, as being the hedges and outmoſt bounds of keeping thy Name from being prophaned, as we would be fearfull not onely of a deep pit, but alſo of dancing nigh the brink thereof; not onely eſchewing the plague, but alſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ragge that may ſeeme to carry the plague with it: Let us be carefull to avoid the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſuch incorrigible ſinners; becauſe the tinder of our corruption is ſo eaſily ſet on fire by the leaſt ſpark of their evill preſidents and lewd company.

               <p>If then by admonition you would not loſe, obſerve carefully theſe Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look that you have a good ground out of the Word for reproving.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look if it ſtand with your calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Afterward conſider, if any other man might doe it more profitably then you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look before whom you reprove, leſt you hinder the credit of the party with his friends, and increaſe his diſcredit with his foes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When you ſee your lawfull calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this or any other ſinne, then conſider that you muſt put on you the perſon of the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:115434:140"/>offender, that as you ſpare not his ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the zeal of Gods glory, ſo you preſſe it not too farre, becauſe of compaſſion to a brother.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then look that your heart bee right in zeale and love, and ſo call for Gods aſſiſtance before you ſpeak, his grace in ſpeaking, and his bleſſing after your ſpeaking.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If you remember any thing left out that might have been profitable, pleaſe not your ſelfe in it, but be humbled for it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If you finde that ſome infirmities have been in you, yet ſhall they not doe ſo much hurt, as Gods bleſſing on his ordinance ſhall doe good. For though the party admoniſhed doe many times either deny the thing, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the affection of the ſpeaker, yet when he hath chafed with his owne ſhadow, and diſputed with his own reaſon, it will come to paſſe that hee will ſpeak reverently of him behind his back, whom hee much gainſaid before his face.</p>

            <p>THat you may not doubt of the truth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the forementioned judgements of God upon Swearers and Curſers, even in this life, may be added and remembred (if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truth in common report) the example of that which lately was known to be executed in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> upon a rude Ruffian companion in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne there, a health-out drinking, or a life-out healthing wretch, who in the midſt of his heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and carrowſing, would attempt to drink a health to the Devill; and if the Devill would not come and pledge him, hee would not (hee ſaid) beleeve there was any God or Devill. At which heaven daring blaſphemy, and hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſtening impious attempt, the reſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions (and it was high time) haſted out of the roome; and preſently after hearing a hideous noyſe, and ſmelling a ſtinking ſavour, the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ran up into the chamber, as knowing that ſuch a gueſt was there: But comming in, hee miſſed his gueſt, and found the window to bee broken, and the barre in the ſame to be bowed, with blood on the ſaid batre. I heard this from the mouthes of many men, ſince this Tract was printed. I leave it by all drunken, ſwearing, and Devill-deſiring wretches, to themſelves to bee applied.</p>
